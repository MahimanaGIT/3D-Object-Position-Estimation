# 3D-Object-Position-Estimation

This project was made for NASA Space Robotics Challenge for estimating the 3D location of objects and obstacle in the simulation to score for estimating the 3D location of the objects correctly.

As this project was made for NASA Space Robotics Challenge the pipeline or the code for the project can be published till the challenge ends.
